As of 10/13/22, a seamless wallet integration for Paypal-to-CoinTracker is not available. At best, you would need to download your transactions from PayPal, reformat the CSV file, and upload into CoinTracker.

Thankfully, CoinTracker provides the following steps to integrate your PayPal wallet
1. Download the CSV transations export from PayPal
2. Reformat the CSV file
3. Import the file into CoinTracker

This link, https://community.cointracker.io/t/convert-any-csv-into-the-cointracker-csv-format/553, provides a video walkthrough on how to properly convert any CSV file into a CoinTracker approved format.
